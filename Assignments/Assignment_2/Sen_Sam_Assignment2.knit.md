## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations

### Research Question

**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**

Your analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.

### Required Analysis Steps

Complete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:

#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)

Load the required spatial data:
- Pennsylvania county boundaries
- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)
- Pennsylvania census tracts

**Your Task:**


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)    
library(sf)           
library(tidycensus)   
library(tigris)       
```

# Load spatial data

::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Pennsylvania county boundaries
pa_counties <- counties(state = "PA", cb = TRUE, year = 2022)
```

#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data 

Use `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.

**Required variables:**
- Total population
- Median household income
- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)

**Your Task:**

#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations 

Identify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:
1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)
2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)




::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Define vulnerable populations using quartile approach
vulnerable_tracts <- pa_tracts_with_data %>%
  mutate(
    pct_elderly = (pop_65_plus_total / total_popE) * 100,
    low_income = median_incomeE < 55924,           # Bottom quartile
    high_elderly = pct_elderly >= 20.1,            # Top quartile
    vulnerable = low_income & high_elderly
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(median_incomeE))

print(paste("Vulnerable tracts:", sum(vulnerable_tracts$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Vulnerable tracts: 148"
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
print(paste("Percentage:", round(sum(vulnerable_tracts$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE) / nrow(vulnerable_tracts) * 100, 2), "%"))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Percentage: 4.37 %"
```


:::
:::



::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Check the quartiles of each category
summary(vulnerable_tracts$median_incomeE)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  11558   55924   70188   77527   93287  250001 
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
summary(vulnerable_tracts$pct_elderly)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   0.00   12.49   16.53   16.54   20.11   63.07 
```


:::
:::




**Questions to answer:**

Income Threshold: I chose a median household income threshold of $55,924, representing the first quartile (bottom 25%) of income distribution across Pennsylvania census tracts. Elderly Population Threshold: I selected 20.1% as the threshold for significant elderly population, representing the third quartile (top 25%) of elderly population distribution. These quartile-based thresholds were chosen to identify the most vulnerable populations given limited city resources for healthcare investment. By focusing on tracts in both the bottom quartile for income and the top quartile for elderly population, we ensure that our analysis prioritizes areas with the greatest need—where financial barriers to healthcare access coincide with high concentrations of elderly residents who face increased healthcare needs. Results: Using these criteria, 148 census tracts representing 4.37% of Pennsylvania census tracts meet both vulnerability criteria. This focused approach allows policymakers to target resources toward communities where vulnerable populations are most concentrated.

#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals 

For each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Transform to Pennsylvania South State Plane (EPSG:3365)
pa_counties_projected <- pa_counties %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3365)

hospitals_projected <- hospitals %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3365)

# Filter to vulnerable tracts and transform
vulnerable_tracts_projected <- vulnerable_tracts %>%
  filter(vulnerable == TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3365)
```
:::




::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Calculate distance from each vulnerable tract centroid to nearest hospital
vulnerable_tract_centroids <- vulnerable_tracts_projected %>%
  st_centroid()

vulnerable_distances <- st_distance(vulnerable_tract_centroids, hospitals_projected)

vulnerable_tracts_projected <- vulnerable_tracts_projected %>%
  mutate(
    dist_to_hospital_ft = as.numeric(apply(vulnerable_distances, 1, min)),
    dist_to_hospital_mi = dist_to_hospital_ft / 5280
  )

# Summary statistics
avg_distance <- mean(vulnerable_tracts_projected$dist_to_hospital_mi, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Average distance to nearest hospital:", round(avg_distance, 2), "miles"))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Average distance to nearest hospital: 4.97 miles"
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
max_distance <- max(vulnerable_tracts_projected$dist_to_hospital_mi, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Maximum distance:", round(max_distance, 2), "miles"))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Maximum distance: 19.16 miles"
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
far_tracts <- sum(vulnerable_tracts_projected$dist_to_hospital_mi > 15, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Vulnerable tracts more than 15 miles from hospital:", far_tracts))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Vulnerable tracts more than 15 miles from hospital: 10"
```


:::
:::


**Run these two chunks and let me know what you get!**

**Summary:**
Projection Choice: I used Pennsylvania South State Plane (EPSG:3365) because it's optimized for accurate   distance measurements within Pennsylvania. Unlike geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) which measure in degrees, this projected coordinate system uses feet, allowing us to calculate actual distances in miles.

- Average distance to nearest hospital: 4.97 miles  
- Maximum distance: 19.16 miles 
- # of vulnerable tracts 15< miles away from hospital: 10 

---

#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas 

Define "underserved" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Create underserved variable
vulnerable_tracts_projected <- vulnerable_tracts_projected %>%
  mutate(
    underserved = dist_to_hospital_mi > 15
  )

# Summary statistics
underserved_count <- sum(vulnerable_tracts_projected$underserved, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Underserved tracts:", underserved_count))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Underserved tracts: 10"
```


:::

```{.r .cell-code}
pct_underserved <- (underserved_count / nrow(vulnerable_tracts_projected)) * 100
print(paste("Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved:", round(pct_underserved, 2), "%"))
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```
[1] "Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved: 6.76 %"
```


:::
:::

10 tracts are undeserved representing ~7% of the population. This number is slightly lower than I expected, as I would expected a higher proportion of undeserved populations to have limited access to hospitals; however, this still represents thousands of undeserved and extremely vulnerable individuals. It is possible that that these individuals are located in rural areas. Since a majority of the vulnerable population does live within 15 miles of hospitals, it is possible that they are located in more urban envirornments. In the next steps we will examine the spaital aspects of these findings.

#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level

Use spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.

**Your Task:**

::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Spatial join to match vulnerable tracts to their counties
vulnerable_tracts_with_county <- vulnerable_tracts_projected %>%
  st_join(pa_counties_projected, join = st_within)
```
:::


# Aggregate statistics by county

::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# Aggregate statistics by county
county_summary <- vulnerable_tracts_with_county %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(NAMELSAD.y) %>%
  summarize(
    num_vulnerable_tracts = n(),
    num_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_underserved = (num_underserved_tracts / num_vulnerable_tracts) * 100,
    avg_distance_to_hospital = mean(dist_to_hospital_mi, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_underserved))

# Display results
print(county_summary)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}

```

The above table looks at the top 5 counties that have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts. However, this data isn't overwhelmingly telling of anything. It shows that the of the 1 vulnerable tract that each of these counties have, that tract is also underserved.These counties are likely somewhat rural, with the vulnerable population all clustered together in tract.

**Questions to answer:**
Several of the counties that have 1 underserved tract also have just 1 vulnerable. Many of these counties are rural, suggesting that a vulnerble tract (high elderly population and low income) is automatically considered underserved given the likely large distance between tracts in that rural county and hospitals. However, this is not always the case. For example, Dauphin County is right outside of Harrisburg and fairly urban, implying that the underserved tract there is likely on the very outskirts. 

Places like Clearfield and Crawford have several vulnerable tracts, but only one underserved tract. This makes sense given their mixed nature with small cities. While more of their tracts are considered vulnerable, a lower proportion are underserved given their urban nature and distance to hospitals. This phenonmenon of high levels of vulnerability and low levels of underserved populations in urban areas is most evidently observed in Philadelphia, which has 17 vulnerable tracts yet 0 underserved tracts.

**Requirements:**
- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting
- Include descriptive column names
- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)
- Add an informative caption
- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)

## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization 

Using the skills from Week 3 (Data Visualization), create publication-quality maps and charts.

  mutate(pct_underserved = ifelse(is.na(pct_underserved), 0, pct_underserved))

# Create the map

          size = 0.3) +
  # Hospital locations as points
  geom_sf(data = hospitals_projected,

  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightyellow", 
                      high = "darkred",

The above map shows the percent of vulnerable tracts that are underserved and the location of hospitals marked by the dark blue "+" symbols per the assignments instructions. As can be seen, these large counties have very few hospitals, with a 3 of them having no hospitals at all.

However, the map is somewhat misleading. Many of these counties only have 1 tract that is vulnerable. This map makes could be misleading in making it seem like these whole counties are vulnerable and underserved.

**Your Task:**

::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}

          color = "darkgreen",
          size = 1.5,
          alpha = 0.8,
          shape = 3) +
  labs(title = "Underserved Vulnerable Populations in Pennsylvania",
       subtitle = "Red = underserved vulnerable tracts (>15 mi from hospital) | Blue = other vulnerable tracts | + = Hospitals",

The above map shows vulnerable tracts in light blue with a dark boarder, and vulnerable underserved tracts in dark red. As can be seen, none of the dark red tracts have a hospital in them. For Philadelphia, despite having many hospitals, there are still the highest number of vulnerable tracts.

The histogram above shows that a majority of vulnerable populations live within 10 miles of hospitals. With only a few living more than 15 miles away from a hospital, qualifying them as underserved. These populations are at a very high level of risk, but many other factors in addition to distance from a hospital can put vulnerable populations at risk. Of the top 10 counties with the highest vulnerable populations, one of the counties - Clearfield - has a tract that that is also underserved. 

**Suggested chart types:**
- Histogram or density plot of distances
- Box plot comparing distances across regions
- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county
- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size

**Requirements:**
- Clear axes labels with units
- Appropriate title
- Professional formatting
- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)

## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis 

Choose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.

### Challenge Options

Choose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). 

**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question**

I chose the Philadelphia Parks & Recreation (PPR) Program Sites dataset. This dataset contains recreation centers, playgrounds, and other youth-focused facilities operated by Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. I selected this dataset because recreation centers provide critical after-school programming, sports facilities, and community activities for children and youth, making them an important complement to the hospital access analysis from Part 1. This analysis will examine whether vulnerable populations (low-income elderly) live in areas that also lack youth educational and recreational resources.

Data source: OpenDataPhilly (Philadelphia Parks & Recreation Department). The dataset was last updated in November 2024 according to the "Programs 11/24" notation in the data source field.

The dataset contains 171 recreation facilities across Philadelphia.

The data is in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326), a geographic coordinate system. We will need to transform it (see below) to Pennsylvania South State Plane (EPSG:3365) to match the projected coordinate system used in Part 1 and enable accurate distance calculations in miles.

**Interpretation:**

The analysis reveals modest disparities in recreation center access between vulnerable and non-vulnerable populations in Philadelphia. Vulnerable tracts are located an average of 0.43 miles from the nearest recreation center compared to 0.37 miles for non-vulnerable tracts, and only 70.6% of vulnerable tracts fall within a half-mile walking distance compared to 80.1% of non-vulnerable tracts. While these differences suggest that vulnerable populations may have slightly worse access to recreational facilities, further statistical testing would be necessary to determine whether these observed differences are statistically significant or could be attributed to random chance. 
A permutation test or similar randomization procedure would help establish whether the 0.06-mile average difference and the 9.5 percentage point gap in coverage represent meaningful disparities requiring policy intervention. Overall, both groups demonstrate relatively good access to recreation centers, with most Philadelphia tracts located within comfortable walking distance of these facilities.
