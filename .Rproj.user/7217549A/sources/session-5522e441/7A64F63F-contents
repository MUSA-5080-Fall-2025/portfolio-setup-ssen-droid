# Assignment Overview

## Scenario

You are a data analyst for the New York Department of Human Services. The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.

Drawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis
- Evaluate data quality using margins of error 
- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making
- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues
- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders

## Submission Instructions

**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/assignments/assignment_1/`

Make sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an "Assignments" menu.

- text: Assignments
  menu:
    - href: assignments/assignment_1/your_file_name.qmd
      text: "Assignment 1: Census Data Exploration"


If there is a special character like comma, you need use double quote mark so that the quarto can identify this as text

# Setup

```{r setup}
# Load required packages (hint: you need tidycensus, tidyverse, and knitr)

# Set your Census API key

# Choose your state for analysis - assign it to a variable called my_state
```
```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(stringr)

options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
my_state <- "New York"  
acs_year <- 2022



```

**State Selection:** I have chosen **New York** for this analysis because I am originally from NYC and would like to take a deep dive into some of the census data for this area. 

# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment

## 2.1 Data Retrieval

**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.

**Requirements:**
- Geography: county level
- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  
- Year: 2022
- Survey: acs5
- Output format: wide

**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = "code")` syntax.

```{r county-data}
# Write your get_acs() code here

# Clean the county names to remove state name and "County" 
# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()

# Display the first few rows
```

```{r}
# ---- 2.1 County-level data (ACS 2022 5-year) ----
vars <- c(
  med_income = "B19013_001",  # Median household income
  total_pop  = "B01003_001"   # Total population
)

county_raw <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  variables = vars,
  year = 2022,
  survey = "acs5",
  state = my_state,
  output = "wide"
)

county <- county_raw %>%
  mutate(
    county = NAME %>%
      stringr::str_remove(",\\s*.*$") %>%  # drop ", State"
      stringr::str_remove("\\s*County$")   # drop trailing "County"
  ) %>%
  select(
    county, GEOID,
    med_incomeE, med_incomeM,
    total_popE,  total_popM
  )

knitr::kable(
  head(county, 10),
  caption = paste("County-level ACS (2022 5-year) for", my_state),
  digits = 0
)


```


## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100
- Create reliability categories:
  - High Confidence: MOE < 5%
  - Moderate Confidence: MOE 5-10%  
  - Low Confidence: MOE > 10%
- Create a flag for unreliable estimates (MOE > 10%)

**Hint:** Use `mutate()` with `case_when()` for the categories.

```{r income-reliability}
# Calculate MOE percentage and reliability categories using mutate()

# Create a summary showing count of counties in each reliability category
# Hint: use count() and mutate() to add percentages
```

```{r}
# ---- 2.2A: compute MOE% for median income ----
county_moe <- county %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    income_moe_pct = dplyr::if_else(
      !is.na(med_incomeE) & med_incomeE > 0 & !is.na(med_incomeM),
      100 * med_incomeM / med_incomeE,
      NA_real_
    )
  )

# peek at just the columns we care about
knitr::kable(
  county_moe %>%
    dplyr::select(county, med_incomeE, med_incomeM, income_moe_pct) %>%
    head(10),
  caption = "MOE% for median income (first 10 counties)",
  digits = c(0, 0, 0, 1)
)

```
```{r}
# ---- 2.2B: add reliability category ----
county_reliability <- county_moe %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    reliability = dplyr::case_when(
      is.na(income_moe_pct) ~ "Unavailable",
      income_moe_pct < 5    ~ "High Confidence",
      income_moe_pct <= 10  ~ "Moderate Confidence",
      income_moe_pct > 10   ~ "Low Confidence"
    )
  )

# quick preview
knitr::kable(
  county_reliability %>%
    dplyr::select(county, med_incomeE, med_incomeM, income_moe_pct, reliability) %>%
    head(10),
  caption = "Income MOE% + reliability category (first 10)",
  digits = c(0, 0, 0, 1)
)

```
```{r}
# ---- 2.2C: unreliable flag + summary table ----
county_reliability <- county_reliability %>%
  dplyr::mutate(unreliable = income_moe_pct > 10)

rel_summary <- county_reliability %>%
  dplyr::count(reliability) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(pct = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(match(reliability, c("High Confidence","Moderate Confidence","Low Confidence","Unavailable")))

knitr::kable(rel_summary, caption = "County reliability categories", digits = 1)

```

## 2.3 High Uncertainty Counties

**Your Task:** Identify the 5 counties with the highest MOE percentages.

**Requirements:**
- Sort by MOE percentage (highest first)
- Select the top 5 counties
- Display: county name, median income, margin of error, MOE percentage, reliability category
- Format as a professional table using `kable()`

**Hint:** Use `arrange()`, `slice()`, and `select()` functions.

```{r high-uncertainty}
# Create table of top 5 counties by MOE percentage

# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption
```

```{r}
# ---- 2.3: Top 5 counties by income MOE% ----
top5_uncertainty <- county_reliability %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(income_moe_pct)) %>%                 # ignore rows where MOE% couldn't be computed
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(income_moe_pct)) %>%           # highest MOE% first
  dplyr::slice(1:5) %>%                                     # top 5
  dplyr::transmute(                                         # select + rename for presentation
    county,
    `Median income ($)` = med_incomeE,
    `Income MOE ($)`    = med_incomeM,
    `Income MOE %`      = sprintf("%.1f%%", income_moe_pct),
    Reliability         = reliability
  )

knitr::kable(
  top5_uncertainty,
  caption = "Top 5 counties by median income MOE% (ACS 2022 5-year)"
)

```

**Data Quality Commentary:**

[The counties that have higher % reliability are likely to benefit less from algorithmic decision making. These margins of error are too large to give us high confidence in the median income figures. Therefore, algorithms that use this data may cause harm. For example, if the state decides that counties that have <$60K median income will receive social services, Hamilton looks like it's well above this threshold but with such a high margin of error this may not be the case.]

# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis

## 3.1 Focus Area Selection

**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.

**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.

```{r select-counties}
# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data
# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties

# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics
# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category

county_reliability %>%
  dplyr::select(county, med_incomeE, income_moe_pct, reliability) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(income_moe_pct)

```
```{r}
# ---- 3.1: pick counties for tract-level study ----
selected_counties <- county_reliability %>%
  dplyr::filter(county %in% c("Kings", "Greene", "Hamilton")) %>%
  dplyr::select(county, GEOID, med_incomeE, income_moe_pct, reliability)

knitr::kable(
  selected_counties,
  caption = "Selected counties for tract-level analysis"
)

```

**Comment on the output:** Only one county in New York is low confidence with regard to MOE - Hamilton, NY. This is likely due to extremely small population size coupled with small sample perhaps. 

## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics

**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.


**Requirements:**
- Geography: tract level
- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)
- Use the same state and year as before
- Output format: wide
- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.


# ---- 3.2: Tract-level demographics (percentages only) ----

```{r}
# ---- 3.2: Tract-level demographics ----

# 1) Variables
vars_tracts <- c(
  white_nh  = "B03002_003",  # White alone, not Hispanic or Latino
  black_nh  = "B03002_004",  # Black alone, not Hispanic or Latino
  hispanic  = "B03002_012",  # Hispanic or Latino
  total_pop = "B03002_001"   # Total population
)

# 2) Convert 5-digit county GEOIDs to 3-digit county FIPS
county_codes3 <- stringr::str_sub(selected_counties$GEOID, -3, -1)

# (optional safety check)
stopifnot(length(county_codes3) > 0, all(nchar(county_codes3) == 3))

# 3) Pull tract-level ACS for those counties
tract_raw <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = vars_tracts,
  year      = acs_year,   # you defined acs_year <- 2022 above
  survey    = "acs5",
  state     = my_state,
  county    = county_codes3,   # <-- 3-digit FIPS codes here
  output    = "wide"
)

# 4) Clean tract/county names and compute percentages
# NAME is like: "Census Tract 123, Kings County, New York"
tract_demo <- tract_raw %>%
  tidyr::separate(NAME, c("tract_label","county_label","state_label"),
                  sep = ", ", remove = FALSE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    tract_label  = stringr::str_remove(tract_label, "^Census Tract\\s*"),
    county_label = stringr::str_remove(county_label, "\\s*County$"),
    pct_white_nh = dplyr::if_else(total_popE > 0, 100 * white_nhE / total_popE, NA_real_),
    pct_black_nh = dplyr::if_else(total_popE > 0, 100 * black_nhE / total_popE, NA_real_),
    pct_hispanic = dplyr::if_else(total_popE > 0, 100 * hispanicE / total_popE, NA_real_)
  )

# 5) Quick peek
knitr::kable(
  tract_demo %>%
    dplyr::select(
      GEOID, tract_label, county_label,
      total_popE, white_nhE, pct_white_nh,
      black_nhE, pct_black_nh,
      hispanicE, pct_hispanic
    ) %>% head(10),
  caption = "Tract demographics with population percentages (first 10 rows)",
  digits = 1
)

```



## 3.3 Demographic Analysis

**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.

```{r demographic-analysis}
# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents
# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract

# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()
# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group

# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()
```
```{r}
# ---- 3.3A: tract with highest % Hispanic ----
top_hispanic_tract <- tract_demo %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(pct_hispanic)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(1) %>%
  dplyr::select(GEOID, tract_label, county_label,
                total_popE, pct_white_nh, pct_black_nh, pct_hispanic)

knitr::kable(top_hispanic_tract,
             caption = "Tract with the highest % Hispanic")

```
```{r}
# ---- 3.3B: summarize by county ----
county_summary_weighted <- tract_demo %>%
  dplyr::group_by(county_label) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    total_pop    = sum(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),
    white_nh     = sum(white_nhE, na.rm = TRUE),
    black_nh     = sum(black_nhE, na.rm = TRUE),
    hispanic     = sum(hispanicE, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_tracts     = dplyr::n()
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    pct_white_nh = 100 * white_nh / total_pop,
    pct_black_nh = 100 * black_nh / total_pop,
    pct_hispanic = 100 * hispanic / total_pop
  )

knitr::kable(county_summary_weighted,
             digits = 1,
             caption = "County-wide demographics (population-weighted)")

```
```{r}
# ---- 3.3: Weighted county-level demographics ----

county_summary_weighted <- tract_demo %>%
  dplyr::group_by(county_label) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    total_pop    = sum(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),
    white_nh     = sum(white_nhE, na.rm = TRUE),
    black_nh     = sum(black_nhE, na.rm = TRUE),
    hispanic     = sum(hispanicE, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_tracts     = dplyr::n(),

                "% White (NH)", "% Black (NH)", "% Hispanic"),
  caption = "County-wide demographics (ACS 2018–2022 5-year, weighted by population)"
)

```


# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation

## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables

**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable
- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%
- Create summary statistics

```{r demographic-moe}
# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables
# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)

# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable
# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement

# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues
```
```{r}
# ---- 4.1: MOE analysis for demographic variables ----

tract_moe <- tract_demo %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    # MOE% for each group
    white_moe_pct    = ifelse(white_nhE > 0, 100 * white_nhM / white_nhE, NA),
    black_moe_pct    = ifelse(black_nhE > 0, 100 * black_nhM / black_nhE, NA),
    hispanic_moe_pct = ifelse(hispanicE > 0, 100 * hispanicM / hispanicE, NA),

    # flag if any group’s MOE% > 15
    high_moe_flag = (white_moe_pct > 15) | (black_moe_pct > 15) | (hispanic_moe_pct > 15)
  )

# summary of how many tracts have high MOE issues
tract_moe_summary <- tract_moe %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    total_tracts = dplyr::n(),
    high_moe_tracts = sum(high_moe_flag, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_high_moe = 100 * high_moe_tracts / total_tracts
  )

knitr::kable(tract_moe_summary,
             digits = 1,
             caption = "Summary of high-MOE tracts (ACS 2018–2022 5-year)")

```

## 4.2 Pattern Analysis

**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.

```{r pattern-analysis}
# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues
# Calculate average characteristics for each group:
# - population size, demographic percentages

# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison
# Create a professional table showing the patterns
```

```{r}
# ---- 4.2: Pattern analysis ----

pattern_analysis <- tract_moe %>%
  dplyr::group_by(high_moe_flag) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    n_tracts        = dplyr::n(),
    avg_pop         = mean(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_pct_white   = mean(pct_white_nh, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_pct_black   = mean(pct_black_nh, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_pct_hispanic= mean(pct_hispanic, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

knitr::kable(
  pattern_analysis,
  digits = 1,
  col.names = c("High MOE Flag", "Tracts", "Avg Pop",
                "Avg % White (NH)", "Avg % Black (NH)", "Avg % Hispanic"),
  caption = "Comparison of tracts with vs. without high MOE issues"
)

```
```{r}
# ---- 4.2: Count flags per group by county ----

flags_by_county <- tract_moe2 %>%
  dplyr::group_by(county_label) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    white_flags    = sum(over15_white,    na.rm = TRUE),
    black_flags    = sum(over15_black,    na.rm = TRUE),
    hispanic_flags = sum(over15_hisp,     na.rm = TRUE),
    total_tracts   = dplyr::n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

knitr::kable(
  flags_by_county,
  caption = "Number of tracts with MOE% > 15% for each group, by county"
)


```


**Pattern Analysis:** [In rural counties like Greene and Hamilton, ACS reliability issues fall disproportionately on minority groups: nearly every Black and Hispanic estimate is flagged as unreliable, while White estimates are more stable. In contrast, in Kings County (Brooklyn), almost every tract shows MOEs above 15% for all racial/ethnic groups (White ≈91%, Black ≈88%, Hispanic ≈96%). This demonstrates that in small-population counties, unreliability is concentrated on underrepresented groups, while in large urban counties the problem is structural to the tract-level ACS — margins of error are high across the board. For policy and algorithmic applications, this means that minority communities in rural areas risk being systematically undercounted, while in urban areas all groups are at risk of noisy estimates that could mislead algorithmic decision-making


# Part 5: Policy Recommendations

## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary

**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.

**Executive Summary Requirements:**
1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?
2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?
4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?

**Executive Summary:**

[Your integrated 4-paragraph summary here]

## 6.3 Specific Recommendations

**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.

```{r recommendations-data}
# Create a summary table using your county reliability data
# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category

# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():
# - High Confidence: "Safe for algorithmic decisions"
# - Moderate Confidence: "Use with caution - monitor outcomes"  
# - Low Confidence: "Requires manual review or additional data"

# Format as a professional table with kable()
```

**Key Recommendations:**

**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.

1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** [List counties with high confidence data and explain why they're appropriate]

2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** [List counties with moderate confidence data and describe what kind of monitoring would be needed]

3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]

## Questions for Further Investigation

[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]
